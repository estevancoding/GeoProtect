# GeoProtect

## Overview

**GeoProtect** is a **RESTful API** for managing and querying geographic risk zones. Developed as a university project, its core is a Spring Boot backend designed for geospatial data processing.

A separate **React frontend** application is included as a **demonstration and testing interface**. This frontend allows for the visualization of geographic risk zones on an interactive map and real-time location simulation.

The entire system is secured by JWT-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the API's functionalities.
